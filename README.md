# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christian

**Christian-von-Uffel/christian-von-uffel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently building [FilmsForMe.com](https://www.filmsforme.com), an open-source and ads-free movie recommendations platform.

Previously I've built a number of web apps:
- a privacy tool that removes tracking codes from URLs [RemoveTrackingCodes.com](https://www.RemoveTrackingCodes.com)
- a tool to create pie charts on the web [ChartSimply.com](https://www.ChartSimply.com) 
- a tool that values hypothetical crypto investments [IfYouBoughtCryptoWhen.com](https://www.IfYouBoughtCryptoWhen.com)
- a chrome extension that helps people vet books when they have few reviews [IsThisBookGood.com](https://www.IsThisBookGood.com)

Currently, I'm teaching myself the basics of back-end, learning how to work with Supabase, etc.
