# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christian

<!--
**Christian-von-Uffel/christian-von-uffel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently building [FilmsForMe.com](www.filmsforme.com), an open-source and ads-free movie recommendations platform.

Previously I designed and built a number of web apps:
- a privacy tool that removes tracking codes from URLs [RemoveTrackingCodes.com](www.RemoveTrackingCodes.com)
- what may be the easiest way to create pie charts on the web [ChartSimply.com](www.ChartSimply.com) 
- a tool that evaluates hypothetical crypto investments [IfYouBoughtCryptoWhen.com](www.IfYouBoughtCryptoWhen.com)
- a chrome extension that helps judge books when they have few reviews [IsThisBookGood.com](www.IsThisBookGood.com)

Currently, I'm teaching myself the basics of back-end, learning how to work with Firebase and Supabase, etc.

When I'm not trying to improve my coding and design skills, you can find me bouldering at [Austin Bouldering Project](https://austinboulderingproject.com/), grilling steak, and [hanging out by the pool](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool)
